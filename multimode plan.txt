Each language excels at different parts:

Python: AI model development, data preprocessing, research
C++: Real-time processing, hardware drivers, core algorithms
Java: Application layer, user interfaces, enterprise integration

Common Hybrid Architectures:
1. Research → Production Pipeline
Python (Development) → C++ (Production Core) → Java (Application Layer)

Train AI models in Python
Implement optimized matching in C++
Build user interface in Java
